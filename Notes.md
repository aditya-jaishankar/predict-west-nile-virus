## Ideas for Feature Engineering

1. Make dummy columns for each of the `CodeSum` entires.
2. Split the date into month halves. That might be more indicative of when the incidence of west nile is highest i.e. we bucket the tests.
3. Check to see if there is a time lag. i.e. after it rains, mosquitos take a while to breed. So is there some reason to believe that there is a correlation between mosquito sightings and days since rain?
4. Likewise, wha about temperature and weather. It is important to think in terms of time lag - appropriate weather conditions are probably correlated with mosquito sightings downstream.
5. Is there more dispersal after higher wind conditions?
6. average temperature over the last week
7. average rainfall over the last week
8. wind direction and magnitude, and does that lead to more mosquitos downstream?
9. Is there more incidence of mosquitos in a particular species?
10. Investigate relationshiop between trap number and the number of sightings

## Transmission factors for west nile virus

1. Increased temperature can lead to increased viral transmission rate
2. Heavy precipitation how shown to increase viral transmission rate
3. Wind can serve as a dispersal mechanism for mosquitos
